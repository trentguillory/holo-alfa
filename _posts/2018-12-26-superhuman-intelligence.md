title: Superhuman Intelligence
summary: Can we create a generation of humans that are superintelligent? What would be the result if we could?

In his book *Superintelligence*, Nick Bostrom analyzes all possible paths to achieving intelligence that extend beyond what is currently humanly attainable. After exploring the typical computational answers via standard "AI", he turns his attention to what the medical field has to offer - technology-aided "selective breeding." As it sounds, such a pursuit would have hundreds of serious implications. What would be the result of such a path?

### First of all, let's clear up what's on the table.

Rapid improvements could be made in human intelligence if in vitro fertilization were employed by the majority of the population in their reproductive efforts. This is what I meant above by "selective breeding." IVF allows the best embryo of many to be selected for implantation.<sup>1</sup> Here's a figure provided by Bostrom: 

If 1 in 10 embryos were selected for implantation based on IQ for 10 generations, the resulting gain in IQ could be as high as 130 points.

At first glance, this seems easy to accomplish. Don't forget, though, that each generation requires 20 to 30 years before the next can begin. "250 years" sounds a lot longer than "10 generations."

If it already sounds like we're hijacking the human body, just wait: This 250-year process could be fast-tracked with the help of stem cell-derived gametes and iterated embryo selection.

With stem cell-derived gametes, multiple generations of IVF optimizations could be achieved in a short amount of time. Rather than selecting the best IVF embryo and waiting for them to bear children to repeat the process, stem cells could be harvested and used within 6 months to repeat the process. This shortcuts the "250 year" timeline listed above to as little as five years. Once again, mass adoption would be necessary, but the technology needed is theoretically currently available.<sup>2</sup>

### What effects would this have on society?

A society in which the Average Joe has an IQ higher than that of Albert Einstein and Nikola Tesla is hard to imagine, but some aspects of this hypothetical world are conceivable. Here are a few positive ones that came to my mind:
1. Humans would quickly outgrow many current occupations. Low-skill or highly-repetitive jobs like truck driving, cashiering, and production-line manufacturing would be among the first to be completely handed off to a wide range of narrow AIs. 
2. As mentioned above, humans of that caliber of intellect could easily develop any narrow AI to take their place doing menial tasks. Software and robots would be designed for each job left behind.
3. This shift in type of work could lead to better work conditions. There would be many more desk jobs and most likely more accommodating office hours, considering AIs would be handling all tasks crucial to day-to-day survival.
4. The development of general AI would progress much faster. Whether or not this is good for mankind is out for debate, but it would certainly come into existence sooner given these conditions. 

Some negative effects come to mind as well.
1. Increased susceptibility to mental illness and depression has been observed in those endowed with great intellect.<sup>3</sup> 
2. The complete automation of so many sectors could farther widen the abyss of freedom and deepen the existential vacuum<sup>4</sup> this generation is already experiencing. 

### To conclude this experiment...

It appears to me as though mankind would both benefit greatly and be detrimentally impacted by such enhanced intellect. Today, we take for granted the variety of mental activities we can balance and enjoy: intellectual, creative, recreational, etc. Each of these qualities are crucial to leading a healthy life. Artificially maxing-out intellect is a surefire way to topple this balance. As imagined above, the result would be technological advancements akin to that of science fiction. Unfortunately, massive changes such as these are likely to bring along with it a mental toll that leaves mankind in a worse place than where it began.

<sup><sup>1</sup>Today, analysis of IVF embryos primarily considers the potential success of implantation. With advances in our understanding of DNA sequencing, however, it's not hard to imagine a reality in which the choice of embryo is based on many characteristics: lower likelihood of certain diseases, certain physical attributes, and of course increased intelligence.</sup>

<sup><sup>2</sup>It's worth noting that Bostrom's (and my own) expertise is not in the medical field. These are generalizations based on various studies and scientific claims.</sup>

<sup><sup>3</sup>The articles I've read on this topic are correlational, meaning a high IQ may not be the cause of such adversities. It may be linked in a way we have yet to understand, though.</sup>

<sup><sup>4</sup>This term is used as Victor Frankl describes it in his book *Man's Search for Meaning.* Ultimately, our present age seems plagued with a sense of purposelessness. This is an example of a crisis being dealt with by both generations as a whole and individuals within these generations.</sup>
